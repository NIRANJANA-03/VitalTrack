# VITAL-Track :Health Condition Prediction Based on Lifestyle
This repository contains the implementation of a machine learning pipeline to predict health conditions based on lifestyle data. The project compares the performance of two classification algorithms: K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) and Random Forest. The goal is to provide insights into how lifestyle factors influence health outcomes.

## Project Overview

This project leverages data on various lifestyle habits (e.g., diet, exercise, and habits like smoking) to predict health conditions. It uses two machine learning models to evaluate their predictive accuracy and compare their performance metrics.

### Features:

* Age, Height, Weight: Basic demographic data.
* Lifestyle Factors: Includes variables like family history, frequency of vegetable consumption (FAVC), physical activity frequency (FAF), and transportation mode.
* Behavioral Factors: Smoking (SMOKE), alcohol consumption (CALC), and water intake (CH2O).
